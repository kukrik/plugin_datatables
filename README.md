# QDataTables Plugin

This QCubed is a wrapper for the DataTables jQuery plugin. 

This DataTables plugin (v1.9.x) for jQuery was developed out of the desire to allow highly configurable access to HTML tables with advanced access features.

For detailed information on the plugin itself, please refer to the DataTables web-pages: http://www.datatables.net

This control is now installable by Composer. To install, add the following to the corresponding sections of your composer.json root file:
```
	"repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",

        }
    ],
```    
and
